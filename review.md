#### Prelimenary Design  11/11
Interesting design.  I would suggest, however, displaying time horizontally rather than vertically. It's more in line with users' mental models of time.

#### Justification  0/7
Your design decisions need justification.  How do your decisions help the client accomplish the "why" tasks you've identified?
